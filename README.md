This project aims to create a humble reproduction of ChatGPT, trained on French penal right datasets. It consists of three components: the back-end, the front-end, and the NLP service.

To start the back-end, navigate to the 'back' folder and run the command `go run .*go`.

To start the front-end, navigate to the 'front' folder and run the command `yarn start`.

To start the NLP service, go to the `nanoGPT-master` folder, activate the virtual environment 'myenv', and run the command `python flask_api.py`.
